# Unit Allocation System - Fixed Implementation

## What Was Fixed

The unit allocation system was encountering errors because:

1. **Missing Table**: API endpoints were looking for a `student_unit_allocations` table that didn't exist
2. **Wrong Column Names**: Using `created_at` instead of `registration_date` 
3. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Async params issue in document routes

## New Implementation

Instead of creating a separate allocation table, the system now uses the existing `student_units` table with different status values:

- **`status = 'allocated'`** → Unit has been allocated by admin but not yet registered
- **`status = 'registered'`** → Student has registered for the allocated unit

## Database Schema

The existing `student_units` table is used:
```sql
CREATE TABLE student_units (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    unit_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    registration_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'registered',
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (unit_id) REFERENCES units(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(student_id, unit_id)
);
```

## How It Works

### 1. Admin Allocation Process
- Admin selects a student and units to allocate
- System creates records in `student_units` with `status = 'allocated'`
- Student can now see these units in their "Available for Registration" section

### 2. Student Registration Process
- Student sees allocated units (status = 'allocated')
- When student registers, system updates `status` from 'allocated' to 'registered'
- Registered units appear in student's "Current Registered Units" section

### 3. API Endpoints

- **`/api/admin/allocate-units`** → Creates allocation records
- **`/api/students/allocated-units`** → Fetches units with status 'allocated'
- **`/api/students/register-units`** → Updates status from 'allocated' to 'registered'

## Testing the System

### Step 1: Add Sample Data
Run this SQL in Supabase to add test data:

```sql
-- Add sample units
INSERT INTO units (unit_name, unit_code, description, credits) VALUES
('Introduction to Programming', 'CS101', 'Basic programming concepts', 3),
('Database Systems', 'CS201', 'Database design and SQL', 3),
('Web Development', 'CS301', 'Modern web development', 4)
ON CONFLICT (unit_code) DO NOTHING;

-- Add allocated units for testing (replace 1 with actual student ID)
INSERT INTO student_units (student_id, unit_id, status) 
SELECT 1, u.id, 'allocated'
FROM units u 
WHERE u.unit_code IN ('CS101', 'CS201')
ON CONFLICT (student_id, unit_id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 2: Test Admin Allocation
1. Go to admin dashboard (`/admin`)
2. Use "Unit Allocation Form"
3. Select a student and units
4. Click "Allocate Selected Units"

### Step 3: Test Student Registration
1. Login as the student
2. Check "Available Units for Registration" section
3. Select allocated units
4. Click "Register Selected Units"
5. Verify they appear in "Current Registered Units"

## Files Modified

- `app/api/students/allocated-units/route.ts` → Fixed to use student_units table
- `app/api/admin/allocate-units/route.ts` → Fixed to use student_units table  
- `app/api/students/register-units/route.ts` → Fixed to update status instead of creating new records
- `app/api/students/documents/[regNumber]/route.ts` → Fixed Next.js 15 async params

## Workflow

```
1. Admin allocates units → student_units (status: 'allocated')
2. Student sees allocated units → Query status = 'allocated'
3. Student registers → Update status to 'registered'
4. Student sees registered units → Query status = 'registered'
```

This approach is simpler and uses the existing database structure without requiring additional tables.
