```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Component Integration
The academics section is integrated into the `ModernStudentDashboard` component:
```tsx
import { AcademicsSection } from "./AcademicsSection"

// In the render method
<AcademicsSection 
  activeSection={activeSection}
  units={units}
  onUnitsChange={setUnits}
  studentData={studentData}
  user={user}
/>
```
